Youtube is great for music discovery, compilation, and organization.

With a nice [json api](http://www.kimonolabs.com/api/9zx1t7xi?apikey=4f21782b1ec4ec297572ee4991f4e1d5) courtesy of [kimono](http://www.kimonolabs.com/), I programatically built a youtube playlist from [Resident Advisor's top 100 tracks of 2014 chart](http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj-charts.aspx?top=100&yr=2014). It's rough, but good enough.

Oh, I almost forgot -- these 'chart generated playlists' will work great in [plug.dj](http://plug.dj)!
