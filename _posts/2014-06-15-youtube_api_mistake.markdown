In the middle of writing a script to generate Youtube playlists from Resident Advisor charts [like this one](http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj-charts.aspx?top=50), I exceeded the Youtube API's request limit. I checked Youtube and my playlist wasn't populated, so I decided to give up for awhile, figuring if my playlist didn't save, nothing else happened.

Unfortunately, something else *did* happen--my script triggered 100 tweets, one for each song, proclaiming:

>I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/YZqwEINfq48?a  Tiger Stripes - Keep A Movin' - DESOLAT 036

and even mixing it up with some foreign language coolness:

>Adicionei um v√≠deo a uma playlist @YouTube http://youtu.be/dtFbggVT9MI?aSo  Inagawa - Sensibilia

One nice thing about not having a lot of followers is that there aren't as many people you can possibly offend. :) Now, time to figure out how to disable this Youtube/Twitter integration...
